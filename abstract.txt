The validity of conclusions from scientific investigations is
typically strengthened by the replication of results by independent
researchers. Full replication of a study's results using independent
methods, data, equipment, and protocols, has long been, and will
continue to be, the standard by which scientific claims are evaluated.
However, in many fields of study, there are examples of scientific
investigations which cannot be fully replicated, often because of a
lack of time or resources. In such situations, there is a need for a
minimum standard which can serve as an intermediate step between full
replication and nothing. This minimum standard is reproducible
research, which requires that datasets and computer code be made
available to others for verifying published results and conducting
alternate analyses. The tutorial will provide an introduction to tools
for conducting reproducible research. We will focus on the R
statistical computing language and will discuss other tools that can
be used for producing reproducible documents.
