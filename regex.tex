\begin{frame}{Regular expressions}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Regular expressions form a meta-language
\item
Regular expressions can be thought of as a combination of literals and
\textit{metacharacters}
\item
To draw an analogy with natural language, think of literal text
forming the words of this language, and the metacharacters defining
its grammar
\item
Regular expressions have a rich set of metacharacters
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Literals}
Simplest pattern consists only of literals.  The literal ``nuclear''
would match to the following lines:
\begin{verbatim}
Ooh. I just learned that to keep myself alive after a 
nuclear blast! All I have to do is milk some rats 
then drink the milk. Aweosme. :}

Laozi says nuclear weapons are mas macho

Chaos in a country that has nuclear weapons -- not good.

my nephew is trying to teach me nuclear physics, or 
possibly just trying to show me how smart he is 
so I'll be proud of him [which I am].

lol if you ever say "nuclear" people immediately think 
DEATH by radiation LOL
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Literals}
The literal ``Obama'' would match to the following lines
\begin{verbatim}
Politics r dum. Not 2 long ago Clinton was sayin Obama 
was crap n now she sez vote 4 him n unite? WTF? 
Screw em both + Mcain. Go Ron Paul!

Clinton conceeds to Obama but will her followers listen??  

Are we sure Chelsea didn't vote for Obama?

thinking ... Michelle Obama is terrific!

jetlag..no sleep...early mornig to starbux..Ms. Obama 
was moving
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Regular Expressions}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Simplest pattern consists only of literals; a match occurs if the
sequence of literals occurs anywhere in the text being tested
\item
What if we only want sentences that end in 
the word ``Clinton'', or ``clinton'' or ``clinto''? 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Regular Expressions}
We need a way to express
\begin{itemize}
\item
whitespace word boundaries
\item
sets of literals
\item
the beginning and end of a line
\item
alternatives (``war'' or ``peace'')
\end{itemize}
Metacharacters to the rescue!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Metacharacters}
Some metacharacters represent the start of a line
\begin{verbatim}
^i think 
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
i think we all rule for participating
i think i have been outed
i think this will be quite fun actually
i think i need to go to work
i think i first saw zombo in 1999.
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Metacharacters}
\$ represents the end of a line
\begin{verbatim}
morning$ 
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
well they had something this morning
then had to catch a tram home in the morning
dog obedience school in the morning
and yes happy birthday i forgot to say it earlier this morning 
I walked in the rain this morning
good morning
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Character Classes with []}
We can list a set of characters we will accept at a given point in the
match
\begin{verbatim}
[Bb][Uu][Ss][Hh]
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
The democrats are playing, "Name the worst thing about Bush!"
I smelled the desert creosote bush, brownies, BBQ chicken
BBQ and bushwalking at Molonglo Gorge
Bush TOLD you that North Korea is part of the Axis of Evil 
I'm listening to Bush - Hurricane (Album Version)
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Character Classes with []}
\begin{verbatim}
^[Ii] am
\end{verbatim}
will match
\begin{verbatim}
i am so angry at my boyfriend i can't even bear to 
look at him

i am boycotting the apple store

I am twittering from iPhone

I am a very vengeful person when you ruin my sweetheart.

I am so over this. I need food. Mmmm bacon...
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Character Classes with []}
Similarly, you can specify a range of letters [a-z] or 
[a-zA-Z]; notice that the order doesn't matter
\begin{verbatim}
^[0-9][a-zA-Z]
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
7th inning stretch
2nd half soon to begin. OSU did just win something
3am - cant sleep - too hot still.. :(
5ft 7 sent from heaven 
1st sign of starvagtion
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Character Classes with []}
When used at the beginning of a character class, the ``\verb+^+'' is also a 
metacharacter and indicates matching characters NOT in the 
indicated class
\begin{verbatim}
[^?.]$
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
i like basketballs 
6 and 9
dont worry... we all die anyway! 
Not in Baghdad
helicopter under water? hmmm
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More Metacharacters}
``.'' is used to refer to any character. So
\begin{verbatim}
9.11
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
its stupid the post 9-11 rules 
if any 1 of us did 9/11 we would have been caught in days.
NetBios: scanning ip 203.169.114.66
Front Door 9:11:46 AM
Sings: 0118999881999119725...3 !
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More Metacharacters: $|$}
This does not mean ``pipe'' in the context of regular expressions;
instead it translates to ``or''; we can use it to combine two
expressions, the subexpressions being called alternatives
\begin{verbatim}
flood|fire
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
is firewire like usb on none macs? 
the global flood makes sense within the context of the bible 
yeah ive had the fire on tonight 
... and the floods, hurricanes, killer heatwaves, rednecks, gun nuts, etc. 
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More Metacharacters: $|$}
We can include any number of alternatives...
\begin{verbatim}
flood|earthquake|hurricane|coldfire
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
Not a whole lot of hurricanes in the Arctic.
We do have earthquakes nearly every day somewhere in our State 
hurricanes swirl in the other direction 
coldfire is STRAIGHT! 
'cause we keep getting earthquakes
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More Metacharacters: $|$}
The alternatives can be real expressions and not just literals
\begin{verbatim}
^[Gg]ood|[Bb]ad
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
good to hear some good knews from someone here 
Good afternoon fellow american infidels! 
good on you-what do you drive? 
Katie... guess they had bad experiences... 
my middle name is trouble, Miss Bad News
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More Metacharacters: ( and )}
Subexpressions are often contained in parentheses to constrain the 
alternatives
\begin{verbatim}
^([Gg]ood|[Bb]ad)
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
bad habbit 
bad coordination today 
good, becuase there is nothing worse than a man in kinky underwear
Badcop, its because people want to use drugs 
Good Monday Holiday 
Good riddance to Limey
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More Metacharacters: ?}
The question mark indicates that the indicated expression is optional
\begin{verbatim}
[Gg]eorge( [Ww]\.)? [Bb]ush
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
i bet i can spell better than you and george bush combined
BBC reported that President George W. Bush claimed God told him to invade Iraq 
a bird in the hand is worth two george bushes 
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{One thing to note...}
In the following
\begin{verbatim}
[Gg]eorge( [Ww]\.)? [Bb]ush
\end{verbatim}
we wanted to match a ``.'' as a literal period; to do that, we had to
``escape'' the metacharacter, preceding it with a backslash In
general, we have to do this for any metacharacter we want to include
in our match
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More metacharacters: * and +}
The * and + signs are metacharacters used to indicate repetition; * 
means ``any number, including none, of the item'' and + means ``at 
least one of the item''
\begin{verbatim}
\(.*\)
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
anyone wanna chat? (24, m, germany)
hello, 20.m here... ( east area + drives + webcam ) 
(he means older men) 
()
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More metacharacters: * and +}
The * and + signs are metacharacters used to indicate repetition; * 
means ``any number, including none, of the item'' and + means ``at 
least one of the item''
\begin{verbatim}
[0-9]+ (.*)[0-9]+
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
working as MP here 720 MP battallion, 42nd birgade 
so say 2 or 3 years at colleage and 4 at uni makes us 23 when and if we finish
it went down on several occasions for like, 3 or 4 *days*
Mmmm its time 4 me 2 go 2 bed
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More metacharacters: \{ and \}}
\{ and \} are referred to as interval quantifiers; the let us specify
the minimum and maximum number of matches of an expression
\begin{verbatim}
[Bb]ush( +[^ ]+ +){1,5} debate
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
Bush has historically won all major debates he's done. 
in my view, Bush doesn't need these debates..
bush doesn't need the debates? maybe you are right 
That's what Bush supporters are doing about the debate. 
Felix, I don't disagree that Bush was poorly prepared for the debate.
indeed, but still, Bush should have taken the debate more seriously.
Keep repeating that Bush smirked and scowled during the debate 
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More metacharacters: \{ and \}}
\begin{itemize}
\item
\{m,n\} means at least m but not more than n matches
\item
\{m\} means exactly m matches
\item
\{m,\} means at least m matches
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More metacharacters: ( and ) revisited}
\begin{itemize}
\item
In most implementations of regular expressions, the parentheses not
only limit the scope of alternatives divided by a ``$|$'', but also
can be used to ``remember'' text matched by the subexpression enclosed
\item
We refer to the matched text with \verb+\1+, \verb+\2+, etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More metacharacters: ( and ) revisited}
So the expression 
\begin{verbatim}
 +([a-zA-Z]+) +\1 +
\end{verbatim}
will match the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
time for bed, night night twitter!

blah blah blah blah 

my tattoo is so so itchy today

i was standing all all alone against the world outside...

hi anybody anybody at home

estudiando css css css css.... que desastritooooo
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More metacharacters: * revisited}
The \verb+*+ is ``greedy'' so it always matches the \textit{longest}
possible string that satisfies the regular expression. So
\begin{verbatim}
^s(.*)s
\end{verbatim}
matches
\begin{verbatim}
sitting at starbucks

setting up mysql and rails

studying stuff for the exams

spaghetti with marshmallows

stop fighting with crackers

sore shoulders, stupid ergonomics
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{More metacharacters: ( and ) revisited}
The greediness of \verb+*+ can be turned off with the \verb+?+, as in
\begin{verbatim}
^s(.*?)s$
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item Regular expressions are used in many different languages; not
  unique to R.
\item Regular expressions are composed of literals and metacharacters
  that represent sets or classes of characters/words
\item Text processing via regular expressions is a very powerful way
  to extract data from ``unfriendly'' sources (not all data comes as a
  CSV file)
\end{itemize}
(Thanks to Mark Hansen for some material in this lecture.)
